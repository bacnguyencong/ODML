### Prerequisites
This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Linux (Mac should be fine).

## Installation
Download the folder "ODML" into the directory of your choice. Then within MATLAB go to file >> Set path... and add the directory containing "ODML" to the list (if it isn't already). That's it.

## Usage
```matlab
>> demo
```
